This was a project to test my basic Javascript Knowledge.
It is a basketball scoreboard.
For the home players, it adds up their points and displayes it clearly.
For the guest players, it also adds up their numbers and displays them.
This simple app ensures there is fairness in playing and players can be rest assured there is no cheating whatsoever.
More funcitonalities would be added to it as time goes by.
